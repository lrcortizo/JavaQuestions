/*
    Background: We have a Shape abstract class that represents geometric shapes.
    With the draw() method the shape can draw itself, so a Rectangle can extend Shape and implement
    it's own draw() method.

    The problem:  We want to add additional behaviour to the draw method, e.g. draw with a red border
    or draw with a thick pen.  And we want to add this behaviour at runtime, not compile time. i.e.
    If we package this class structure as a .jar then an external developer should be able to add new
    type of behaviour to draw, without changing our existing code.
    Design the class structure to support this.
